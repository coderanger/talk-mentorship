    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>The mission of the Speak Up! project is to assist in the guidance and
        mentorship of potential conference, usergroup and other technical
        speakers, tutorial presenters, attendees, and others. We hope by providing
        access to mentors from <i>many</i> programming languages who are
        seasoned speakers, conference organizers, or other volunteers we can
        grow not just the gender diversity of speakers at technical events, but
        the diversity of speakers at technical conferences as a whole.
    </p>

    <p>Through positive, reinforcing, polite, and safe actions - we all can
        increase the diversity of voices in our communities, conferences and
        elsewhere.
    </p>

    <p>This means that we wish to help train and guide those who might be
        considering submitting a conference proposal, or those who are just
        setting on the road to speaking at a conference or user group and
        who wish to learn what and how to prepare to speak. This may include
        one on one mentorship, pointers to resources, in person mentorship,
        guidance to a local user group (in order to practice a talk in a smaller
        venue), connecting speakers with other training and outreach groups such
        as <a href="http://www.devchix.com/">DevChix</a>,
        <a href="http://www.pyladies.com/">PyLadies</a> and others.
    </p>

    <p>Additionally; our mentors and volunteers may be able to assist in
        connecting potential speakers with groups attached to a specific
        conference or community for additional mentorship and guidance; perform
        talk reviews, give pointers and other things - such as the polite push
        and encouragement.
    </p>

    <p>Finally, our mentors and volunteers may be able to assist potential
        budding speakers connect to grants and outreach programs for specific
        conferences for assistance to attend and speak at a conference.
